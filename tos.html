							In the terms of this agreement, "you" and "your"
							refers to any user who participates in the service,
							"us" and "our" refers to those who develop and runs
							JT-99, and "admins" refers to the management of any
							servers who have elected their server into this
							program.

					<h3>The Basics</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A. First and foremost, by sending a message, you
							agree that your content does not violate Discord's
							Terms of Service or Community Guidelines. These
							legally-binding agreements govern the use of our
							service on this platform and your use of the
							platform in sending messages that will be
							broadcasted to several servers. We expect these to
							be respected and followed.
						</li>
						<li>
							B. You agree that the messages you send out do not
							violate any rules of the server you are broadcasting
							it in. Admins retain the right to punish any
							misbehavior that occurs as a result of a server
							member broadcasting content that violates their
							rules. Additionally, admins are strongly encouraged
							to report any significant violations of their rules
							to JT-99.
						</li>
						<li>
							C. Administrators are not to encourage any
							violations of our Terms of Service, even if the
							encouragement occurs on a channel outside of the
							server's linked channel.
						</li>
						<li>
							D. When setting up the bot, admins must give it the
							following permissions:
							<ol class="">
								<li>
									Manage Messages, to allow management to take
									down broadcasts that violate these terms.
								</li>
								<li>
									View Channel / Send Messages, to allow the
									bot to read and send messages in the linked
									channel.
								</li>
								<li>
									Manage Webhooks, to allow the bot to create
									and manage the webhook that will be used to
									broadcast outside messages to the channel.
								</li>
								<li>
									Add Reactions, to allow the user to know if
									their message was blocked due to a user,
									guild, or global suspension.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li>
							E. JT-99 was built with the community of each
							server, as a whole, in mind, regardless of one's
							status in the server. Any form of exclusivity is
							prohibited. Some examples of this exclusivity
							includes locking access behind a level, activity, or
							server currency requirement or requiring the user to
							do something in order to gain access. Admins may
							remove a user's access if they are repeatedly
							breaking these terms. Tools have been given to both
							administrators and our staff members to punish bad
							behavior and to swiftly take down messages that
							violate these terms. Locking behind a verification
							system for the purpose of preventing alt accounts
							from accessing the server and/or channel is allowed.
						</li>
						<li>
							F. When you post any content to be broadcasted, you
							give us permission to publish, publicly perform, or
							publicly display your content to all "linked"
							servers. You agree that your content does not
							infringe the copyright or privacy of others. To
							request DMCA takedown, email
							<a
								href="mailto:support@buape.com?subject=JT-99%20DMCA%20Takedown%20Request"
								>support@buape.com</a
							>.
						</li>
						<li>
							G. Should you decide you want to withdraw your
							server from the network, you are free to do so
							anytime. However, you must run the /unlink command
							first. Failure to delete the channel or webhook
							without unlinking will result in the bot throwing an
							error for every message because it is trying to send
							to a webhook that does not exist. We would have to
							manually remove your deleted webhook, which takes
							time.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Community Guidelines</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A. Do not use any forms of racial slurs when
							broadcasting.
						</li>
						<li>
							B. Do not advertise any servers when broadcasting,
							including the server you are broadcasting the
							message in. All servers who opt-in may allow their
							invite link to be public.
						</li>
						<li>
							C. Do not broadcast any content that may be
							unsuitable for children under the age of 18.
						</li>
						<li>
							D. Do not harass any individuals or communities.
						</li>
						<li>
							E. Do not broadcast content to evade user blocks,
							server bans, server timeouts, or bot suspensions. Do
							not reply to messages from users who are suspended
							without starting your message with "$$", which is
							used to prevent message from being broadcasted.
						</li>
						<li>
							F. Do not use excessive profanity when broadcasting.
						</li>
						<li>
							G. All broadcasts must be made in English only. Do
							not attempt to encode any broadcasts in a way where
							only some users will understand it.
						</li>
						<li>
							H. Do not attempt to ping everyone or here in any
							broadcasts.
						</li>
						<li>I. Do not spam broadcasts.</li>
						<li>
							J. If any content is posted that severely breaks
							these terms, admins should remove it as soon as
							possible.
						</li>
						<li>
							K. Any harassment or hatred towards other global chat networks will result in a harsher punishment than other harassment (listed in II.D)
						</li>

					<h3>How We Enforce Our Terms</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A. First and foremost, servers who would like to
							participate must get approval from management (also
							known as whitelisted). Administrators must agree to
							these terms before getting approved, and may be
							required to fill out a form to tell us a little bit
							more about the server they would like to participate
							in. No more than 50 servers may participate in the
							program, and servers may be removed for inactivity
							if they are not actively participating to clear up
							some room.
						</li>
						<li>
							B. Servers that violate our terms may be temporarily
							or permanently suspended from use of the service, or
							removed from our whitelist (Section III.A). All
							messages sent from the linked channel will be
							blocked, and the webhook will be disabled,
							preventing any broadcasts from reaching the server
							until the suspension is removed.
						</li>
						<li>
							C. Users that violate our terms may be temporarily
							or permanently suspended from the use of our
							service. All messages sent from the user will be
							blocked from being broadcasted until the suspension
							is removed.
						</li>
						<li>
							D. Auto Enforcement (AE): We will be implementing
							tools that will be automatically enforcing some of
							our terms of service. AE actions can be a broadcast
							block and/or a temporary suspension.
						</li>
						<li>
							E. Manual Enforcement (ME): ME actions will take
							place after a manual review of the content that
							potentially violates our terms of service. We may
							take down the broadcast and/or issue a suspension
							against a server or user.
						</li>
						<li>
							F. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate any
							user or participating server from the Service for
							any reason, with or without a warning.
						</li>
						<li>
							G. Users may at any time join our Base Station
							server and open a support ticket there to report a
							user or guild. They may also email
							<a
								href="mailto:support@buape.com?subject=File%20A%20JT-99%20Report"
								>support@buape.com</a
							>
							to file a report there.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</article>

				<article id="sectionIV">
					<h2 class="major">Section IV</h2>
					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							A. Servers: When a server links a channel, we store
							the server ID, channel ID, and the webhook URL that
							the bot will create in the channel this took place
							in.
						</li>
						<li>
							B. Users: Users who broadcast messages do not have
							anything stored outside of any active suspensions
							that are placed in order to enforce our terms.
						</li>
						<li>
							C. Broadcasts: A broadcast is considered a message
							that is sent in one of the linked channels that the
							bot will broadcast to all participating servers.
							When a broadcast occurs, your message, as well as
							your avatar and display name, will be broadcasted.
							We will store message IDs that are associated with
							broadcasts, to allow us to quickly pull any messages
							that violate our Terms of Service. To keep the
							general nature of Discord, where once a message is
							deleted, it is removed permanently, we do not store
							any information about a message in a private
							channel.
						</li>
						<li>
							D. Unless required by law, we will not publicly
							disclose any data that we collect or utilize.
						</li>
						<li>
							E. All data about messages sent in the network will be deleted after 14 days.
						</li>
