					<p>
						Welcome to the JT-99 network! If you are confused on
						what this is, today is your lucky day because I will
						explain everything in this message!
					</p>
					<p>
						JT-99 is a project that links several servers together.
						When a message is sent in a dedicated channel, it will
						be sent to all particiapting servers' dedicated channel.
						This includes embeds, files, and attachments. Any
						messages that are edited or deleted will also reflect
						all of the messages in other servers, so if you fix a
						typo or want to add more to your message, it will
						automatically update in all participating servers.
					</p>
					<h3>How does this work?</h3>
					<p>
						We utilize the power of webhooks to pull this off.
						Thanks to how webhooks work, your display name and
						server avatar will also be shown as if you sent the
						message (except there will be a "BOT" tag after your
						name). The bot only stores IDs. No message content,
						attachments, or embeds are stored. More information can
						be found in our <a href="/tos">Privacy Policy</a>.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<p>
						If you have a server that's interested in particiapting,
						check our our <a href="#apply">How to Apply</a> page.
						Applications are currently OPEN! Please allow up to 48
						hours to process.
					</p>
					<p>
						Want more information? Check out the
						<a href="#features">features page</a>.

				<article id="moderation">
					<h2 class="major">How We Moderate</h2>
					<p>
						To ensure our network stays nice and tidy, and to keep
						our privilege of providing you of this service on
						Discord, we have written and actively enforce our
						<a href="/tos">Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</a>
						in accordance with Discord's API Terms of Service, which
						is a legal document requiring us to write our own legal
						stuff.
					</p>
					<p>
						If content is posted that violates the terms, the
						moderators in the server it was sent in are the first in
						line for deleting the message. Once a message is deleted
						from the originating server, the content of the message
						in all participating servers are stripped. This gives
						mods the ability to takedown messages without having to
						reach out to anybody!
					</p>
					<p>
						We understand that often, this isn't possible,
						especially in smaller servers. Therefore, we have JT-99
						Moderators, who are next in line for deleting the
						message. Message takedowns can be executed in
						<i>any</i> server, not just the server that the message
						took place in. This means that our mods do not even have
						to join a specific server to remove a message! In
						addition to deleting messages, JT-99 Moderators have the
						ability to suspend users or servers who repeatedly
						violate our terms. This is to ensure that members and
						servers are following the rules.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next and last in line for deleting the message is
						JT-99 Administrators. We are the creator and maintenance
						of the bot. We not only ensure that the bot is working
						as intended, but we are the ones that approve servers
						and review any moderation disputes that may happen (as
						we know that not everyone is perfect, and our mods and
						even we ourselves are not perfect)
					</p>
					<p>
						If you believe that you have been unfairly suspended or
						you want to appeal your suspension, you may do that in
						one of two ways.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							First, you can join our Base Station server and open
							an appeal ticket in our #support channel there.
						</li>
						<li>
							Second, you may send an email to
							<a
								href="mailto:assholes@buape.com?subject=Appeal%20my%20JT-99%20Suspension"
								>assholes@buape.com</a
							>
							and appeal your suspension there.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</article>
				<article id="apply">
					<h2 class="major">How to Apply</h2>
					<p>
						Once you add the bot to the server, you will be able to
						run the `/apply` command. Please note you should
						probably only apply your servers or servers you manage.
						If you don't, consider asking the server's management if
						they would be interested in participating! Trolling in
						your applications will result in punishment, please keep
						your applications serious.
					</p>
					<p>
						After we review your application, if we accept it,
						congratulations! Your server is now approved for the
						network! We will contact you to inform you of our
						decision to accept.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<h2>What We Look For</h2>
					<p>
						Here are some things we look for in an applicant's
						server:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<h4>Memberships.</h4>
							<p>
								We typically don't accept servers with less than
								25 humans in it.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Following TOS.</h4>
							<p>
								We may check to see if your server is following
								Discord's TOS. If it's not, that raises concerns
								for us, because if your members aren't following
								the Discord ToS in your own server, how would we
								know that they would follow both the Discord ToS
								and <a href="/tos">the JT-99 ToS</a>? We also
								don't want to broadcast TOS-breaking content to
								dozens of servers!
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h4>Activity</h4>
							<p>
								Will your members actually engage in the
								network? We are limited in how many guilds can
								join, and we do not want to waste too much
								resources having inactive servers in the
								network! If we start to run low on how many
								servers we can add, we may purge inactive
								servers.
							</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Once you apply, you can join our Base Station and go to
						the #support channel if you want to ask any followup
						questions.
					</p>
					<p>
						After you are approved, go to the channel you want to
						link to the network, and run the /setup command. Just
						like that, your server is in one of the best
						cross-chatting systems on Discord!
