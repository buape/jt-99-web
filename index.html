                    <p>
                        Welcome to the JT-99 network! If you are confused on
                        what this is, today is your lucky day because I will
                        explain everything in this message!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JT-99 is a project that links several servers together.
                        When a message is sent in a dedicated channel, it will
                        be sent to all particiapting servers' dedicated channel.
                        This includes embeds, files, and attachments. Any
                        messages that are edited or deleted will also reflect
                        all of the messages in other servers, so if you fix a
                        typo or want to add more to your message, it will
                        automatically update in all participating servers.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How does this work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        We utilize the power of webhooks to pull this off.
                        Thanks to how webhooks work, your display name and
                        server avatar will also be shown as if you sent the
                        message (except there will be a "BOT" tag after your
                        name). The bot only stores IDs. No message content,
                        attachments, or embeds are stored. More information can
                        be found in our <a href="/tos">Privacy Policy</a>.
                    </p>
                    <hr />
                    <p>
                        If you have a server that's interested in particiapting,
                        check our our <a href="#apply">How to Apply</a> page.
                        Applications are currently OPEN! Please allow up to 48
                        hours to process.

                <article id="moderation">
                    <h2 class="major">How We Moderate</h2>
                    <p>
                        To ensure our network stays nice and tidy, and to keep
                        our privilege of providing you of this service on
                        Discord, we have written and actively enforce our
                        <a href="/tos">Terms of Service and Privacy Policy</a>
                        in accordance with Discord's API Terms of Service, which
                        is a legal document requiring us to write our own legal
                        stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If content is posted that violates the terms, the
                        moderators in the server it was sent in are the first in
                        line for deleting the message. Once a message is deleted
                        from the originating server, the content of the message
                        in all participating servers are stripped. This gives
                        mods the ability to takedown messages without having to
                        reach out to anybody!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We understand that often, this isn't possible,
                        especially in smaller servers. Therefore, we have JT-99
                        Moderators, who are next in line for deleting the
                        message. Message takedowns can be executed in
                        <i>any</i> server, not just the server that the message
                        took place in. This means that our mods do not even have
                        to join a specific server to remove a message! In
                        addition to deleting messages, JT-99 Moderators have the
                        ability to suspend users or servers who repeatedly
                        violate our terms. This is to ensure that members and
                        servers are following the rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next and last in line for deleting the message is
                        JT-99 Administrators. We are the creator and maintenance
                        of the bot. We not only ensure that the bot is working
                        as intended, but we are the ones that approve servers
                        and review any moderation disputes that may happen (as
                        we know that not everyone is perfect, and our mods and
                        even we are not perfect)

                    <p>
                        Once you add the bot to the server, you will be able to
                        run the `/apply` command. Please note you should
                        probably only apply your servers or servers you manage.
                        If you don't, consider asking the server's management if
                        they would be interested in participating!
                        Trolling in your applications will result in punishment, please keep your applications serious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After we review your application, if we accept it,
                        congratulations! Your server is now approved for the
                        network! We will contact you to inform you of our
                        decision to accept.

                    <h2>What We Look For</h2>
                    <p>
                        Here are some things we look for in an applicant's
                        server:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Memberships.</h4>
                            <p>
                                This isn't as important at the moment, but we
                                typically don't accept servers with less than 25
                                humans in it.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Following TOS.</h4>
                            <p>
                                We may check to see if your server is following
                                Discord's TOS. If it's not, that raises concerns
                                for us, because if your members aren't following
                                the Discord ToS in your own server, how would we
                                know that they would follow both the Discord ToS
                                and <a href="/tos">the JT-99 ToS</a>? We also
                                don't want to broadcast TOS-breaking content to
                                dozens of servers!
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Activity</h4>
                            <p>
                                Will your members actually engage in the
                                network? We are limited in how many guilds can
                                join, and we do not want to waste too much
                                resources having inactive servers in the
                                network! If we start to run low on how many
                                servers we can add, we may purge inactive
                                servers.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Once you apply, go to the channel you want to link to
                        the network, and run the /setup command. Just like that,
                        your server is in one of the best cross-chatting systems
                        on Discord!
